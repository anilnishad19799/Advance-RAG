Extending the risk management dimension, failure to document relevant data is itself considered a significant breach of and deviation from the standard of care.1\u20133 Of course, protection from legal jeopardy is far from the only reason for documentation in clinical care. The patient's record provides the only enduring version of the care as it evolves over time and a reference work of value in emergency care, research, and quality assurance. This discussion will outline some basic principles of sound documentation with an emphasis on those aspects that serve the goals of risk management and liability prevention.\r\n\r\nBasic Principles of Documentation\r\nA significant portion of risk management advice regarding documentation unfortunately boils down to the injunction, \u201cYou physicians ought to write more.\u201d From my years in the medicolegal field, I have found that this advice not only fails to be useful, but is actually counter-productive: faced with excessive demands for documentation, many clinicians dig in their heels and refrain from writing at all or from writing down even relevant data.\r\n\r\nWriting more is not the solution; simply writing with greater efficiency will cut down on time spent in documentation. The key to this approach is to keep in mind the three sovereign principles of documentation, which also closely resemble the three principles of medical decision analysis.\r\n\r\nFirst, record the risk-benefit analysis of important decisions in the clinical care of the patient. This risk-benefit analysis should include even obvious or \u201cgiven\u201d benefits. This is a point where many clinicians fall short because, in being risk-aversive, they tend to focus mostly on the risk side without equal attention to the benefit side of a decision. For example, prescribing a particular medication carries a certain risk of side effects, such as allergic reactions or other undesirable outcomes. Clinicians tend to focus on these possible risks and address them in particular in their record progress notes. However, the benefits of these medications are often stinted, and the risks of not receiving the medications are often omitted entirely. When the discussion of a decision, such as whether to medicate, includes both the risks and benefits of each path (prescribe or don't prescribe), the clinician's reasoning is viewed as far more reasonable than if only one of these elements was cited.\r\n\r\nOne way to visualize this issue is to consider a decision tree in which the tree's two branches represent both options: \u201cmedicate\u201d inhabits one branch and \u201cdon't medicate\u201d inhabits the other. Each branch then sprouts two twigs: one for risks, and one for benefits. Thus, there are both risks and benefits of prescribing and risks and benefits in not prescribing in a given case. A physician who has even briefly noted the pros and cons in each branch of this decision may be portrayed by a fact-finder or perceived by a jury later as having been wrong in the conclusion at which he or she arrived, but a jury will not see that physician as negligent since the decision was, as supported by the physician's documentation, the result of a well-thought out process.\r\n\r\nThus, if the patient does in fact suffer an ill effect from medication, it is all too easy for a plaintiff's attorney to portray the physician as having cavalierly prescribed this dangerous substance to the patient; however, if the physician has noted that the goal of this medication is to prevent or improve a condition, the sense of a balanced and reasoned decision becomes much clearer to a lay audience.\r\n\r\nThe second essential point of documentation is the use of clinical judgment at critical decision points. There are many possible definitions of clinical judgment, but a useful one for our purposes is \u201can assessment of the clinical situation and a response congruent to that assessment.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why this essential element of documentation is useful in liability prevention. First, clinical judgment is itself the polar opposite of negligence, one of the critical elements of malpractice. In addition, the exercise of clinical judgment is based on both objective and subjective clinician factors that emerge from the actual encounter with the patient; no one else had that direct experience with the patient. To derive a benefit from the immediacy of these observations, it is critical to identify the decision-making process that goes into this treatment decision.\r\n\r\nObviously, the response to this assessment must be congruent to the clinical needs defined by the patient's assessment. For example, a clinical judgment and response that reads, \u201cPatient still extremely suicidal, discharge today\u201d would clearly fail the test of the congruence of the response to the assessment.\r\n\r\nOne of the subtextual elements in a malpractice situation that is a factor in the determination of standard of care is known as the \u201cprimacy of the on-site observer.\u201d4 This is a principle used by expert witnesses in determining whether the standard of care was met, while giving the benefit of the doubt to the individual who was on the scene at the time, since the latter has access to ephemeral details and subjective clinical data that may never be contained in the record.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5337, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93a066a5-5fb6-48a6-ace5-3d265bf668c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "93a066a5-5fb6-48a6-ace5-3d265bf668c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d6b253b-ec78-4ca3-acf3-ff338a22545d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68841a496e71210928f8f1028e1c1dbd399957b8975b591caf9ff051dffdb570", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "05404538-9a74-4ef8-89d1-373ee07eb71b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e48b74acf875bc4e24ad598476f82ba912b108047cd26ec617cf3de79e57c35e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e81b6bdd-bb7d-45d4-9713-5853d3d1c23b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed8d3a52f43c57b26dfd1d0791c8f46c07537b95e627222c249bc1b8f3376f39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "To derive a benefit from the immediacy of these observations, it is critical to identify the decision-making process that goes into this treatment decision.\r\n\r\nObviously, the response to this assessment must be congruent to the clinical needs defined by the patient's assessment.

However, this benefit of the doubt is lost when the clinical judgment is not recorded.\r\n\r\nThe last sovereign principle of documentation relates to the patient's capacity to participate in his or her own care. Examples of this include the patient's ability to understand the purposes of the various medications being prescribed, the patient's awareness of what symptoms to look for regarding exacerbation of the condition, and the patient's knowledge of what symptoms or states of mind constitute an emergency.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the patient should know who to call in the event of an emergency. Many readers will note that these elements closely resemble a competency assessment; indeed, that is the point at hand. If the physician asks the patient the questions implied above, and records the patient's responses, monitoring of changes in the patient's condition may be delegated to that patient.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a patient who demonstrates no ability to manage these basic details of participation in the medical care plan should have alternative resources made available. This may be as simple as giving the prescribed medications to a spouse, parent, partner, or child to issue to the patient, or as complex as encouraging family members to undertake full guardianship proceedings.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on these three principles of documentation, a short, concise note may effectively take the place of pages of excessive verbiage and thus bring greater efficiency to the burden of record-keeping, while simultaneously achieving the goal of addressing critical risk management factors.\r\n\r\nAudiences for the Record\r\nWhile writing the record, the clinician should keep in mind the possible reader audiences for the record, because this will help achieve sufficient clarity, avoid cryptic communication styles, and achieve the goals of the record in both patient care and liability prevention. Within the clinical realm, the audiences for the record will include other members of the treatment team: on-call physicians, emergency physicians, and those colleagues covering one's practice when the clinician is on vacation or off shift. A more expanded audience will include utilization reviewers, members of professional standards review organization (PSRO) committees, insurers, quality assurance reviewers and similar review organizations, and procedures. In a worst case scenario, a plaintiff's attorney could be another potential audience for the record. Finally, recall that in most jurisdictions, patients themselves are considered a possible audience for the record. Most of the 50 states allow some processes whereby patients are permitted to view their own records.\r\n\r\nThis last point places an additional burden on documentation, because, with the possibility of the patient viewing the record, it should not only reflect skilled professional care, but should also convey tact in its observations. For example, when referring to an individual with a lengthy psychopathic history, rather than describing the patient in disparaging language such as, \u201cThe patient is the typical social deviant with a long history of failed stints,\u201d use more diplomatic phrasing such as, \u201cThe patient has a history of antisocial activity and incarcerations.\u201d One of the greatest contributors to maintaining a tactful tone is the use of the most objective language possible, since even relatively stigmatizing information sounds less judgmental when stated in an objective manner.\r\n\r\nPitfalls and Pointers in Documentation\r\nThe primary pitfall in documentation is attempted alteration. The most critical advice in documentation is that one should never attempt to change an existing record. Do not insert, use little arrows, add inter-lineations, etc. Should a particular record entry need changing for accuracy purposes, to comport with the facts, or to correct an accidental notation in the wrong chart or record, the key principle to remember is the principle of transparency. Transparency refers to the quality of documentation whereby the original and the correction or addition are both clearly marked so that viewers know when the original was written and when corrections or additions were made. No attempt is made to mislead the reader or to \u201cfudge\u201d the record content.

No attempt is made to mislead the reader or to \u201cfudge\u201d the record content. There are several ways to achieve transparency. The most obvious way of correcting a pre-existing entry is to begin a new entry, write the current date and current time, and then describe the correction:\r\n\r\n\u201c[Current date and time]: Review of previous day's entry reveals omission of father's visit, which most likely caused the patient's decompensation shortly afterwards.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile the above emendation does not undo the oversight of omission of this important piece of information, the correction does make clear that the clinician is reading his or her own chart and that he or she understands what is clinically significant by recognizing the relevance of the omission and consequently recording it in the record.\r\n\r\nFor smaller errors, such as typographical errors, misspellings, wrong terms, etc., a single line drawn through the error and a correction out in the margin that does not block the existing entry will suffice; the correction should also be dated and initialed. If time is critical, supply the time of the correction as well.\r\n\r\nThe second general pitfall of documentation can be described as one of tone. As a record of professional activities, the record should maintain a professional tone. This means that sarcasm, demeaning terminology, attempted joking, or even too casual a tone may reflect badly on the clinician. No joking that may have been humorous in the nursing station is ever funny when read aloud from the witness box at a trial during cross-examination. Recall that the average jury understands very little about psychiatric care, and may project their fear and distaste for the mentally ill onto the clinician. If the clinician appears to act out this image through the negative tone of the record entries, it is difficult for the jury to support the notion of careful, professional, objective care devoted to the patient's welfare.\r\n\r\nWhen referring to patient A in the chart of patient B, remember to use the other patient's initials, hospital number, or first name and last initial. This limited information will supply sufficient evidence to guide the care of the contemporary treatment team, while preserving the confidentiality of patient A if patient B's chart must be revealed for some legitimate purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is important to identify the clinicians in question in medical records. When recording staff names, give a staff member's name and discipline. For example, \u201cThe patient was medicated by R. Smithers, RN.\u201d This completes the clear, concise format necessary to provide the relevant information in a given case.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWithin the nightmare of a malpractice suit brought against a physician, a solid documented chart in one's hand is universally recognized as one of the critical elements of the best defense. The principles of documentation outlined above should serve as useful guidance to maintaining successful patient care and effective liability prevention.\r\n\r\nReferences\n\nWhat Are Transformers?\r\nTransformers are a type of neural network architecture that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP).

Output\r\nLLMs: Generate human-like text, making them suitable for applications that require natural language understanding and generation.\r\nTransformers: Produce outputs depending on the task at hand, whether it be text, predictions, or other types of data sequences.\n\nSports Authority of India (SAI) has presence across India. It provides training\r\nfacilities to athletes right from the grass-root level through to the elite level. It is observed that\r\nthere is a tendency of creating sports infrastructure facilities of the highest international\r\nstandards irrespective of the level of athlete / training for which it is intended. This not only\r\nincreases the initial cost but also leads to higher operations and maintenance cost.\r\n2. It is necessary to understand that each International Sports Federation prescribes\r\nspecifications for the Field of Play depending upon the level of competitions; the standards\r\nare higher for global level as compared to national level and still lower for sub-national level.\r\nThe \u201cLux\u201d of artificial lighting, the height of Indoor hall etc. can be lowered; the specifications\r\nof infrastructure facilities can also be lowered for training purpose and the \u2018Run offs\u2019 can be\r\nreduced for the sports discipline, which in turn reduces the area required for the Field of Play.\r\n3. During my visit to various SAI centers across the country, it was observed that often\r\ncoaches and administrators were not fully aware of Field of Play specifications. This\r\nhandbook aims to serve as a ready reckoner on Field of Play specifications for different sport\r\ndisciplines.\r\n4. The instant compilation covers major sports played in India. The combat sports have\r\nnot yet been included. Subsequently, endeavors will be made to cover field of play of\r\nremaining sport disciplines and also cover specifications of equipment used in various\r\nsport disciplines.\r\n5. Though all efforts have been made to ensure the correctness of the information,\r\nhowever, since this is the first publication, any shortcoming may be informed to SAI through\r\ne-mail at infradivisionsai@gmail.com.\r\n6. Director / SE (Infrastructure) of Sports Authority of India has compiled the proposed\r\nspecifications for SAI Regional Centres, Academic Institutions, STCs and SAGs after studying\r\nthe norms prescribed by respective International Sports Federation.

These Rules are not intended to govern issues related to the\r\ngeneral public or training at grass root or even at community level.\r\nThe space required for most games depends on the standard of play; generally the higher the\r\nstandard the larger the space. The playing areas are usually the same size but increased\r\nsafety margins/run offs and clear height may be required for international events.. For most\r\ncompetition play an extra zone is required for team benches and an officials\u2019 table and a\r\nfurther security zone between teams and spectators may be required for major events. Adding\r\nthese margins around the playing area produces the critical overall space. However these\r\nadditional margins are not required for SAI Training Centres. The minimum safe area for each\r\nstandard of sportsactivities undertaken by the young trainees at our SAI Training Centers is\r\nmuch less than what is required for international competitions.\r\nIn view of the above, it is considered necessary to streamline the specifications to be provided\r\nfor infrastructure facilities and compile guidelines on field of plays notified by respective\r\ninternational federations for various SAI centers/STC/SAG, all over India.\r\nSANJIV BARANWAL, IDSE\r\nDirector/SE Infrastructure\r\n Sports Authority of India\r\n- 6 -\r\nFEDERATION OF INTERNATIONAL HOCKEY\r\n(FIH)\r\nHOCKEY\r\n- 7 -\r\n1 HOCKEY\r\n1.1 Field of play (Compiled from FIH Handbook)\r\nThe information below provides a simplified description of the field of play.\r\n\uf0b7 The field of play is rectangular, 91.40 metres long and 55.00 metres wide.\r\n\uf0b7 Side-lines mark the longer perimeters of the field\r\n\uf0b7 Backlines mark the shorter perimeters of the field.\r\n\uf0b7 The goal-lines are the parts of the back-lines between the goal-posts.\r\n\uf0b7 A centre-line is marked across the middle of the field.\r\n\uf0b7 Lines known as 23 metres lines are marked across the field22.90 metres from each\r\nback-line.\r\n\uf0b7 Areas referred to as the circles are marked inside the field around the goals and\r\nopposite the centres of the backlines.\r\n\uf0b7 Penalty spots 150 mm in diameter are marked in front of the centre of each goal with\r\nthe centre of each spot 6.40metres from the inner edge of the goal-line.\r\n\uf0b7 All lines are 75 mm wide and are part of the field of play.\r\n\uf0b7 Flag-posts between 1.20 and 1.50 metres in height are placed at each corner of the\r\nfield.\r\n\uf0b7 Goals are positioned outside the field of play at the centre of and touching each backline.\r\n\uf0b7 Broken lines are marked with their outer edges 5 meters from the outer edge of each\r\ncircle-line; These broken lines became mandatory for international matches with effect\r\nfrom 1 June 2000.

At latitudes\r\nfurther from the equator, the orientation can swing to up to 15\u00ba east or west of northsouth.\r\n1.3 Pitch Classification: FIH has a classification system for synthetic pitches which fall\r\ninto two categories: Global and National. (Until April 2008, the National category was\r\ncalled \u201cStandard\u201d and this terminology will still appear in some publications.)\r\nThe classification is based on a series of pitch performance requirements including the\r\nbehaviour of a hockey ball and drainage characteristics tested under carefully\r\ncontrolled conditions on the finished pitch surface.\r\n- 10 -\r\n1.3.1 Global Category: Global category pitches are mandatory for all FIH world-level\r\ncompetitions and qualifying tournaments such as:\r\n\u00b7 Olympic Games\r\n\u00b7 World Cups\r\n\u00b7 Junior World Cups\r\n\u00b7 Champions\u2019 Trophies\r\n\u00b7 Champions\u2019 Challenges\r\n\u00b7 FIH Olympic Games Qualifying Tournaments\r\n\u00b7 FIH World Cup Qualifying Tournaments\r\nA global category pitch is also sometimes specified in continental or national tournament\r\nregulations.\r\nIf it is not proposed to host one of the above events, it is not necessary to incur the\r\nadditional costs to achieve global category standards.\r\n1.3.2 National Category:National category pitches are satisfactory for international matches\r\nand/or tournaments other than those referred to above.\r\n1.4 Selection of Turf Type: The level of hockey that is proposed for the venue will be a\r\nmajor influence on the type of pitch surface to be laid. There are essentially two main\r\ngroups of pitch surface: natural grass and synthetic turf.\r\n1.4.1 Natural Grass Pitches: There are many types of grass, and expert advice should\r\nbe sought to help in the choice of grass that is most suitable for a particular climate and\r\nsoil conditions. Similarly, advice on whether to seed the pitch or to lay sods should be\r\nsought. The latter is far more expensive, but has the advantage that it can be played\r\non much sooner than a seeded area, which could require at least a year of careful\r\nmaintenance to become sufficiently established to permit safe play without causing\r\nserious damage to the surface.\r\n1.4.2 Synthetic (or Artificial) Turf Pitches There are a number of different types of\r\nsynthetic surface available. However the surfaces proposed to be used in SAI Centres\r\nare considered here. This fall generally undergone of the following headings:\r\n1.4.3 Filled surface: a surface (or carpet) comprising a synthetic yarn filled with sand (or\r\nsimilar material) to the full height of the pile to help maintain its verticality. The pile\r\nheight is greatest in this type of surface. The sand is an important element. A high\r\nquality material with well-rounded particles that allows adequate drainage at all times\r\nand prevents compaction of the fill while under use is usually specified by the pitch\r\nsupplier.\r\n- 11 -\r\nA filled pitch rarely justifies the installation of a watering system. In moderate climates, the\r\nsand within the turf carpet can remain slightly damp for much of the time. However, in warmer\r\nclimates, the pitch will dry out and some degree of watering will greatly improve its playing\r\ncharacteristics. Hence, provision of some form of irrigation (even hand-held hoses) should be\r\nseriously contemplated.\r\n1.4.4 Water-based unfilled surface: a surface (or carpet) comprising a very dense synthetic\r\npile of short length. It is essential from the safety, comfort and playability points of view\r\nthat this type of surface is maintained wet during play. It also ensures that wear on the\r\nturf carpet is minimised and the full expected life of the turf realised.\r\n1.5 Pitch Irrigation or Watering\r\n1.5.1 Sand-filled pitch: in most instances, such a pitch does not justify the expense of\r\ninstalling a watering system. However, it is widely known that the pitch plays better\r\nwhen the sand is slightly damp. Consideration should be given, therefore, to the\r\ninstallation of a water source to enable hand-held hose watering to be carried out.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21240, "end_char_idx": 25866, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91ab9082-3dd6-44b9-9e5d-272163d739fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "91ab9082-3dd6-44b9-9e5d-272163d739fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d6b253b-ec78-4ca3-acf3-ff338a22545d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68841a496e71210928f8f1028e1c1dbd399957b8975b591caf9ff051dffdb570", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "780c2ece-9a4c-4743-8253-3eab8e6ba17c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15e969d1fc57dbdff3dd9b2499dae263ae1b933370efd1f64810ddd60cdae5b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea2bce74-56a3-47be-801e-bc4806488349", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb8496fd2ca14eada315492573afc0ddb3e998e7318adb22dd96dea1c69ced47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Hence, provision of some form of irrigation (even hand-held hoses) should be\r\nseriously contemplated.\r\n1.4.4 Water-based unfilled surface: a surface (or carpet) comprising a very dense synthetic\r\npile of short length.

However, it is widely known that the pitch plays better\r\nwhen the sand is slightly damp. Consideration should be given, therefore, to the\r\ninstallation of a water source to enable hand-held hose watering to be carried out.\r\nThis is more important in hotter, drier parts of the world as the sand will certainly dry\r\nout and tend to become \u201cdust\u201d. Watering will also improve the playing characteristics.\r\n- 12 -\r\nIn more moderate climates, the sand remains damp for longer periods, so the need for\r\nsuch watering will be significantly less.\r\n1.5.2 Water-based unfilled pitch: it is considered essential that this type of pitch is watered\r\nfor every match. In fact, the FIH strongly discourages playing on an inadequately\r\nwatered unfilled pitch. There are four main reasons for this:\r\n\uf0b7 greater risk of injury to players;\r\n\uf0b7 the playability of the pitch is affected: the ball does not travel truly and is more\r\nlikely to bounce dangerously;\r\n\uf0b7 greater wear is caused to the pitch surface, considerably shortening the life of\r\nthe turf, and could affect the manufacturer\u2019s warranty;\r\n\uf0b7 Pitch surface temperatures, particularly in hot climates, can rise to unhealthy\r\nlevels.\r\n1.6 Pitch Carpet Materials (Yarns)\r\nHistorically, turf yarns have been made from nylon, polypropylene or polyethylene, or a\r\ncombination of those. There are some differences in performance characteristics\r\nbetween them and these are discussed below. The FIH does not specify any one type\r\nof yarn; its technical requirements are purely performance based,\r\nNone of the yarn material is completely UV-resistant, but polypropylene is probably the\r\nbest of the three, followed by polyethylene. So for hot, sunny climates, either of these\r\ntwo yarns may be considered.\r\nThe majority of FIH approved manufacturers appears to be moving from polypropylene\r\nto polyethylene yarns because the latter have an improved slide factor, which in turn\r\nrequires the application of less water. This indicates that substantial savings in water\r\nquantity for irrigation can be realised without any consequential adverse effects on\r\npitch playability or player comfort and safety\r\n1.7 Carpet Manufacture\r\nFIH makes no recommendation with regard to the various treatments to the yarn or the\r\nprocesses to form the turf carpet. For example, the yarn may be twisted, curled,\r\nfibrillated, multiplied or have other treatments before it is looped or knitted into a preformed backing fabricant then cut to the desired length. The backing fabric is then\r\nsealed. Manufacture is by weaving, tufting or knitting to the density required for the\r\nparticular type of surface.\r\n- 13 -\r\n1.8 Shock-pads: Shock pad is the resilient material under the synthetic turf carpet\r\ndesigned to absorb kinetic energy. Sometimes referred to as \u2018Shock Absorbing Layer\u2019,\r\n\u2018Elastic Layer\u2019 or \u2018E-Layer\u2019. Early synthetic turfs were laid without a shock-pad. It is now\r\nrecommended that all synthetic pitches be laid with shock-pad as it will help to absorb\r\nthe impact (dynamic forces) of players running on the surface and reduce the incidence\r\nof lower limb injuries. In fact, the FIH now makes a shock-pad mandatory for any pitch\r\nto become classified under its listing. It is recommended to provide In-situ pad, as this\r\nis manufactured on site using a hot mix of rubber shred or crumbs, bound with\r\npolyurethane. It is laid using a highway paving machine. The advantage of this system\r\nis that the pad can be of variable thickness to even out any imperfections in the level of\r\nthe underlying base, and can produce a smooth finish on which to lay the turf carpet.\r\nIt is recommended that the pitch surface and shock-pad be laid on a properly designed and\r\nengineered base and, where necessary, a sub-base. The base should comprise a layer of\r\ngraded stone (which includes the drainage system) overlain by a layer (preferably two layers)\r\nof bituminous material. Carried out properly, the base will outlast by several times the life of\r\nthe shock-pad and surface carpet.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25033, "end_char_idx": 29639, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea2bce74-56a3-47be-801e-bc4806488349": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea2bce74-56a3-47be-801e-bc4806488349", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d6b253b-ec78-4ca3-acf3-ff338a22545d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68841a496e71210928f8f1028e1c1dbd399957b8975b591caf9ff051dffdb570", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "91ab9082-3dd6-44b9-9e5d-272163d739fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6dcb53d2d3bd4a263746f6b76c5fb863eb468523da54fab97f4a80a7b49609a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83686b00-4b2a-49b2-8e3f-d29d08b0898a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51c1e096c2a5b4fb6d33217e75eb64f5bd9033164f73c01ea372208c0a9c9816", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "It is recommended to provide In-situ pad, as this\r\nis manufactured on site using a hot mix of rubber shred or crumbs, bound with\r\npolyurethane.
